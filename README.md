The data comes from this URL.
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

Extract the files into a local directory to simplify using them.  Start with the README file
in the parent directory.  All files can be read with the read.table command. Because the data 
was in a zip file, no attempt was made to read it directly from the Internet.  

This is submitted as the final project for class 4 in Coursera's data science curriculum
"Getting and Cleaning Data."
Beaides there being a code book, the code is commented heavily.
